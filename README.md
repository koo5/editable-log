# editable-log
.emacs file that makes the backlog of circe irc client editable, with periodic autosaving.

Chat and organize at the same time, distill what was said, experiment with using org-mode, syntax highlighting, or other tools at your disposal in emacs. Stay on top of the logs. For bonus points, do it collaboratively on a shared screen on a server. 

This is not a perfect solution, but it is, as far as i know, the only one out there.
